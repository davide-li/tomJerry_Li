    <h1 id="descrizione-dellapplicazione-e-suo-utilizzo">Application Description and Usage</h1>
    <p>Tom and Jerry are Disney cartoons we loved since childhood, and their relationship is both friend and foe, love and conflict.
        In this game, the player simulates becoming Tom the cat, who needs to find all the mice on the map while avoiding being chased by the owner. If the owner catches Tom, and Tom has not captured all the mice, there will be a penalty, and the game will end.
        Additionally, if you step out of the map, you will also be eliminated!</p>

    <h1 id="spiegazione-delle-scelte-effettuate-e-funzionalità-di-webgl-utilizzate">Explanation of WebGL Functionality Used</h1>

    <h2>3D Objects</h2>
    <p>We implemented a skybox using textures and perspective view to create the feeling of an infinite world. ref: <code>drawer.drawSkybox()</code>.<br>
        First, we load the textures for the skybox using <code>geometries.loadSkyBox()</code>, and then, in <code>drawer.drawSkybox()</code>, we render the skybox.
        It’s important to note that we only set the six vertex coordinates for the skybox in the code. When drawing, we calculate the inverse of the view matrix and the corresponding projection matrix. Finally, we pass the skybox information to <code>webglUtil.drawBufferInfo</code>, which helps us successfully render the skybox.</p>

    <p>We created a ground with grass textures to simulate an open environment, making the environment feel more “alive.” ref: <code>drawer.drawFloor()</code>.<br>
        The texture part uses <code>geometries.loadFloor()</code>.<br>
        <code>loadFloor()</code> defines the geometry data for the ground and loads the grass texture. In this method, we set the map size: <code>const S = 80;</code> <code>const H = 0;</code>.<br>
        <code>drawFloor()</code> binds the ground buffer during rendering, sets shader variables, and renders the ground in the scene.</p>

    <p>When Tom leaves the plane, the game transitions to a “game over” screen, where the player can restart the game by clicking the "start" button.<br>
        We handle this in <code>drawer.drawScene()</code> by checking Tom’s position and the number of Jerry mice.</p>

    <p>The scene consists of multiple meshes imported from OBJ format files. The meshes for Tom the cat and Jerry the mouse are quite complex (sourced from <a href="https://sketchfab.com/">sketchfab.com</a>).</p>

    <p>To import these meshes into the scene, we use the <code>loadObj()</code> function.<br>
        For example: <code>function loadTom() { loadObj("resources/obj/Cat.obj") ... }</code> <br>
        <code>function loadJerry() { loadObj("resources/obj/Jerry.obj") ... }</code> <br>
        The <code>loadObj</code> function loads the content, including vertices, texture coordinates, normals, and faces, parsing the file into a data structure used by WebGL.</p>

    <h2>Textures</h2>

    <p>I added textures to all OBJ models, including the skybox, the ground, Jerry the mouse, Tom the cat, and the Boss sphere.</p>

    <p>Textures are created using WebGL’s <code>gl.createTexture()</code> and <code>gl.texImage2D()</code> functions, which apply the mipmap technique to images. <br>
        Texture is a technique used to enhance the appearance of 3D objects’ surfaces by mapping an image or other data (usually a 2D image) onto the surface of a 3D model, adding details, colors, and visual complexity to the model.<br>
        In WebGL, the <code>createTexture()</code> function is used to create a new texture object. This texture object is a placeholder for storing texture data that will be loaded onto the GPU. Its primary purpose is to create an object that can be bound and manipulated in subsequent steps.<br>
        The <code>texImage2D()</code> function in WebGL is used to specify the 2D texture image, loading an image or data into the currently bound texture.<br>
        In our project, these two functions are used in various places.<br>
        The <code>generateMipmap()</code> function in WebGL is a rendering optimization technique used to improve texture rendering performance and visual quality in computer graphics and game development.<br>
        It works by pre-generating a series of progressively smaller resolution texture image levels and selecting the appropriate resolution during rendering based on the distance of the object from the viewer.</p>

    <p>Finally, the owner of Tom the cat is rendered by applying a texture of my photo onto a sphere object.<br>
        Code example:
    <pre><code class="language-js">
    function loadSphere() {
        loadObj("resources/obj/sphere.obj");
        ......
        texture_sphere = loadTextureFromImg("resources/obj/me.png");
    }
    </code></pre>
    </p>
    <img src="boss.png" alt="BOSS">

    <h2>Lighting and Shadows</h2>
    <p>I attempted to simulate natural light by placing a light source above the scene. The light is directional and uses depth textures to calculate which objects are in shadow (and on which side).</p>
    <p>The user can modify the position of the light source along its axes. We defined LightX, LightY, and LightZ to determine the position of the light source.<br>
        Additionally, I added <code>shadowOptions</code> (shadowOn / shadowOff) to test the shadow effects.<br>
        I initialized the light position and shadow intensity, and the code example is as follows:
    <pre><code class="language-js">
        // Light source position and related parameters
        var x_light = 10,
        y_light = 200,
        z_light = 250,
        ......
        lightIntensity = 2.5, // Light source intensity
        shadowIntensity = 0.9; // Shadow intensity
    </code></pre>
    Additionally, I defined functions to update the light's position, with the code as follows:
    <pre><code class ='language-js'>
        // Function to update light source position
        function updateLightx(event, ui) {
            x_light = ui.value; // Update x-axis position of the light source
        }
        function updateLighty(event, ui) {
            y_light = ui.value; // Update y-axis position of the light source
        }
        function updateLightz(event, ui) {
            z_light = ui.value; // Update z-axis position of the light source
        }
    </code></pre>
    Through these methods, the light's position is initialized, and the position updates as objects move in the scene.
    </p>
    <p>I set a bias to reduce the pixelated shadow effect known as "shadow acne."<br>
        Shadow acne occurs due to precision limitations and depth comparison errors, which result in rendering artifacts. By adding a depth bias in the shadow map, these artifacts can be reduced.<br>
        In my project, I initialized <code>var bias = -0.00005;</code> and called it multiple times while loading objects. Here's an example:
    <pre><code class ='language-js'>
        webglUtils.setUniforms(programInfo, {
            u_view: viewMatrix,
            u_projection: projectionMatrix,
            u_bias: bias,
            ......
            u_shadowIntensity: shadowIntensity, // Shadow intensity
        });
    </code></pre>
    When rendering the scene from the light's perspective and generating the shadow map, a small offset is added to the stored depth values.<br>
    This prevents surface pixels from directly overlapping with depth values that have limited precision, reducing shadow acne caused by floating-point calculation errors.<br>
    A challenge with illuminating the scene using this technique is that the shadows appear somewhat pixelated (despite the low bias).<br>
    This is because the object has a low polygon count, making the shadows appear less smooth when enabled.
    </p>
    <p>To improve the visual quality, you can increase the polygon count, or alternatively, implement a more effective shadow algorithm to refine the shape of the shadows.</p>

    <h2>Movement and Collisions</h2>
    <p>The movement of the tom in the scene is based on the cg-car2.js file observed during the course.</p>
    <p>The physics used for movement is a simplified version of the car animation functions, without the need to manage wheels.</p>
    <p>Movement within the map has some collisions.</p>
    <p>By using the position of the controlled character, it is possible to determine if a collision with the enemy chasing us has occurred.</p>
    <p>The player character's position is also used to create the owner's tracking algorithm, where the owner updates their direction based on Tom's position along the x and z axes, modifying the owner's position in each frame.</p>
    <p>Two types of collisions have been implemented:</p>
    <ul>
        <ul>Collisions with the owner</ul>
        <ul>Collisions with Jerry</ul>
    </ul>
    <p>When the owner catches the player, the game enters a game-over state, showing the appropriate screen, and allowing the player to restart the game.</p>
    <img src="youdie.png">
    <p>Collisions with Jerry cause them to disappear. Once all the Jerry mice are collected, a specific control determines the player's victory. Similarly, a view will appear on the screen informing the player of their success and allowing them to restart.</p>
    <img src="youwin.png">
    <p>The barrels in the scene rotate around the y-axis and x-axis, using functions from the library “m4.js”:<br>
        “m4.yRotate(m, angleInRadians, dst)”<br>
        “m4.xRotate(m, angleInRadians, dst)”</p>
    <h2>Interaction with the Interface</h2>
    <p>There are two types of interactions:</p>
    <ul>
        <ul>In-game interaction</ul>
        <ul>Menu interaction</ul>
    </ul>
    <p>In-game interaction can be achieved in the following ways:</p>
    <ul>
        <ul>Via keyboard</ul>
        <ul>Via mouse</ul>
        <ul>Via touch screen (on mobile devices)</ul>
    </ul>
    <h3>Desktop Version</h3>
    <img src="load.png">
    <p>When running the program on a computer, the W, A, S, D keys are used to move the tom (a convention typically used in games with mouse and keyboard input).</p>
    <p>The camera can be controlled with the arrow keys and the mouse. Additionally, the mouse wheel can be used to zoom in or out the camera's distance from the character.</p>
    <p>The interface includes a panel on the right with various buttons and sliders. These buttons allow the camera to be set to three different modes:<br>
        - Rear View<br>
        - Front View<br>
        - Isometric</p>

    <img src="Isomatrica.png">
    <p>The sliders provide the ability to move the light source along the x, z, and y axes (as previously mentioned).<br>
        This feature's effect is more evident when shadows are enabled. Of course, there is an option to choose whether to display shadows or not.</p>
    <h3>Mobile Version</h3>
    <img src="load_iPhone.png">
    <p>To allow users to use the application on smartphones, images representing the "WASD" keys and the "arrowUp, arrowLeft, arrowDown, arrowRight" key layout (sourced from Google images) were inserted into the scene.</p>
    <p>These images are placed on the left and right sides of the canvas, respectively, to simulate controllers, with the right thumb used to move the character and the left thumb to control the camera.</p>
    <h1 id="particolarità-e-sviluppi-futuri">Special Features and Future Developments</h1>
    <p>The special feature of this software is the chase mechanism it proposes. In fact, the game is well-balanced with the enemy's speed, often leading to situations where enemies block the player's path, resulting in a game over.</p>
    <p>Each time the game starts, the positions of Jerry mice and the enemy's spawn are randomized.</p>
    <p>To improve the software in the future, the following features could be implemented:</p>
    <ul>
        <ul>More complex terrain maps</ul>
        <ul>More Jerry mice as targets, with random irregular movement.</ul>
        <ul>Replace the sphere representing the owner with a more interesting obj.</ul>
    </ul>
